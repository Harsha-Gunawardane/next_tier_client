      "correct_answer": 4,
      "explanation": "Noble gases are a group of elements in the periodic table known for their low reactivity and full outer electron shells. These elements include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). Nitrogen (N) is not a noble gas because it does not belong to the group of elements with full outer electron shells and low reactivity. Nitrogen is a diatomic molecule composed of two nitrogen atoms (N2) and is commonly found in the Earth's atmosphere. It is an important element for various biological processes and is widely used in the production of fertilizers, explosives, and other chemical compounds."

      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ionic compounds are formed when there is a strong electrostatic attraction between positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions). In the case of sodium chloride (NaCl), it is an example of an ionic compound. Sodium (N1. is a metal and tends to lose one electron, forming a sodium cation (Na+). Chlorine (Cl) is a nonmetal and tends to gain one electron, forming a chloride anion (Cl-). The electrostatic attraction between the sodium cation and chloride anion leads to the formation of sodium chloride (NaCl), which is commonly known as table salt."

      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "At standard temperature and pressure (STP), one mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters. Since you have 0.5 moles of oxygen gas (O2), the volume would be 0.5 moles * 22.4 L/mole = 11.2 L."

        "4. 2 g",
        "5. 5 g"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Neutralization reactions involve the reaction between an acid and a base to form water and a salt. The balanced equation for the reaction between HCl and KOH is HCl + KOH -> H2O + KCl. The molar ratio of HCl to KOH is 1:1. Given that the concentration (Molarity) of HCl is 0.2 M and the volume is 25 mL (0.025 L), the moles of HCl are 0.2 M * 0.025 L = 0.005 moles. Since the molar ratio is 1:1, you need 0.005 moles of KOH. The molar mass of KOH is approximately 56.11 g/mol, so the mass needed is 0.005 moles * 56.11 g/mol = 0.28055 g, which is approximately 0.5 g."
